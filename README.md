et-express-error-handlers
==============

This package includes the default set of error handlers for ET nodejs apps.  This is intended for applications generated by the [base-app-generator](https://github.exacttarget.com/DevelopmentTools/base-app-generator)

## Requirements

Your application's views folder must have the following:

- 404.handlebars
- 500.handlebars

Your application's layouts folder must have the following:
- errors.handlebars

If your app is generated using the base-app-generator, these templates will already be included.
